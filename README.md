# Coherence-Function-Data-Analysis 
This analysis aims to calculate various parameters about an SPDC crystal and the second-order coherence function g<sup>2</sup>(τ) for both heralded and unheralded photons. Crystal angle and polarisation dependence are inputted and modelled as Gaussian distributions to calculate the crystal width and SPDC type. In addition, g<sup>2</sup>(τ) is calculated by importing data from the coincidence counting units to observe the quantum nature of light. For more information on the theory and results, please see my third-year dissertation, which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15I74rcw3ZxaHnSUxd7CdCN3ogJRqTsIW/view?usp=sharing).
